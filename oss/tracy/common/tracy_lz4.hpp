  Introduction

  LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed >500 MB/s per core,
  scalable with multi-cores CPU. It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in
  multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.

  The LZ4 compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression functions.
  It gives full buffer control to user.
  Compression can be done in:
    - a single step (described as Simple Functions)
    - a single step, reusing a context (described in Advanced Functions)
    - unbounded multiple steps (described as Streaming compression)

  lz4.h generates and decodes LZ4-compressed blocks (doc/lz4_Block_format.md).
  Decompressing such a compressed block requires additional metadata.
  Exact metadata depends on exact decompression function.
  For the typical case of LZ4_decompress_safe(),
  metadata includes block's compressed size, and maximum bound of decompressed size.
  Each application is free to encode and pass such metadata in whichever way it wants.

  lz4.h only handle blocks, it can not generate Frames.

  Blocks are different from Frames (doc/lz4_Frame_format.md).
  Frames bundle both blocks and metadata in a specified manner.
  Embedding metadata is required for compressed data to be self-contained and portable.
  Frame format is delivered through a companion API, declared in lz4frame.h.
  The `lz4` CLI can only manage frames.

/*! In-place compression and decompression
 *
 * It's possible to have input and output sharing the same buffer,
 * for highly constrained memory environments.
 * In both cases, it requires input to lay at the end of the buffer,
 * and decompression to start at beginning of the buffer.
 * Buffer size must feature some margin, hence be larger than final size.
 *
 * |<------------------------buffer--------------------------------->|
 *                             |<-----------compressed data--------->|
 * |<-----------decompressed size------------------>|
 *                                                  |<----margin---->|
 *
 * This technique is more useful for decompression,
 * since decompressed size is typically larger,
 * and margin is short.
 *
 * In-place decompression will work inside any buffer
 * which size is >= LZ4_DECOMPRESS_INPLACE_BUFFER_SIZE(decompressedSize).
 * This presumes that decompressedSize > compressedSize.
 * Otherwise, it means compression actually expanded data,
 * and it would be more efficient to store such data with a flag indicating it's not compressed.
 * This can happen when data is not compressible (already compressed, or encrypted).
 *
 * For in-place compression, margin is larger, as it must be able to cope with both
 * history preservation, requiring input data to remain unmodified up to LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX,
 * and data expansion, which can happen when input is not compressible.
 * As a consequence, buffer size requirements are much higher,
 * and memory savings offered by in-place compression are more limited.
 *
 * There are ways to limit this cost for compression :
 * - Reduce history size, by modifying LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX.
 *   Note that it is a compile-time constant, so all compressions will apply this limit.
 *   Lower values will reduce compression ratio, except when input_size < LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX,
 *   so it's a reasonable trick when inputs are known to be small.
 * - Require the compressor to deliver a "maximum compressed size".
 *   This is the `dstCapacity` parameter in `LZ4_compress*()`.
 *   When this size is < LZ4_COMPRESSBOUND(inputSize), then compression can fail,
 *   in which case, the return code will be 0 (zero).
 *   The caller must be ready for these cases to happen,
 *   and typically design a backup scheme to send data uncompressed.
 * The combination of both techniques can significantly reduce
 * the amount of margin required for in-place compression.
 *
 * In-place compression can work in any buffer
 * which size is >= (maxCompressedSize)
 * with maxCompressedSize == LZ4_COMPRESSBOUND(srcSize) for guaranteed compression success.
 * LZ4_COMPRESS_INPLACE_BUFFER_SIZE() depends on both maxCompressedSize and LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX,
 * so it's possible to reduce memory requirements by playing with them.

 *  and therefore must progress more cautiously into the input buffer to not read beyond the end of block.
 *  On top of that `LZ4_decompress_fast()` is not protected vs malformed or malicious inputs, making it a security liability.
 *  As a consequence, LZ4_decompress_fast() is strongly discouraged, and deprecated.
 *
 *  The last remaining LZ4_decompress_fast() specificity is that
 *  it can decompress a block without knowing its compressed size.
 *  Such functionality can be achieved in a more secure manner
 *  by employing LZ4_decompress_safe_partial().
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *  originalSize : is the uncompressed size to regenerate.
 *                 `dst` must be already allocated, its size must be >= 'originalSize' bytes.
 * @return : number of bytes read from source buffer (== compressed size).
 *           The function expects to finish at block's end exactly.
 *           If the source stream is detected malformed, the function stops decoding and returns a negative result.
 *  note : LZ4_decompress_fast*() requires originalSize. Thanks to this information, it never writes past the output buffer.
 *         However, since it doesn't know its 'src' size, it may read an unknown amount of input, past input buffer bounds.
 *         Also, since match offsets are not validated, match reads from 'src' may underflow too.
 *         These issues never happen if input (compressed) data is correct.
 *         But they may happen if input data is invalid (error or intentional tampering).
 *         As a consequence, use these functions in trusted environments with trusted data **only**.
