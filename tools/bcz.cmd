rem Args:
rem     dbg: manually build the solution in the Debug configuration. If omitted,
rem          we'll use whatever the last configuration build was.
rem     rel: manually build the solution in the Release configuration. If
rem          omitted, we'll use whatever the last configuration build was.
rem     no_clean: Don't clean before building. This is a much faster build
rem          typically, but leaves artifacts from previous builds around, which
rem          can lead to unexpected build failures.
rem     exclusive: Only build the project in the cwd. If omitted, we'll try
rem          building the entire solution instead.
