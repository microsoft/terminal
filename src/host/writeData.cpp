// Routine Description:
// - Creates a new write data object for used in servicing write console requests
// Arguments:
// - siContext - The output buffer to write text data to
// - pwchContext - The string information that the client application sent us to be written
// - cbContext - Byte count of the string above
// - uiOutputCodepage - When the wait is completed, we *might* have to convert the byte count
//                      back into a specific codepage if the initial call was an A call.
//                      We need to remember what output codepage was set at the moment in time
//                      when the write was delayed as it might change by the time it is serviced.
// Return Value:
// - THROW: Throws if space cannot be allocated to copy the given string

// - Stores some additional information about lead byte adjustments from the conversion
//   in WriteConsoleA before the real WriteConsole processing (always W) is reached
//   so we can restore an accurate A byte count at the very end when the wait is serviced.
// Arguments:
// - fLeadByteCaptured - A lead byte was removed from the string before converted it and saved it.
//                       We need to report to the original caller that we "wrote" the byte
//                       even though it is held in escrow for the next call because it was
//                       the last character in the stream.
// - fLeadByteConsumed - We had a lead byte in escrow from the previous call that we stitched onto the
//                       front of the input string even though the caller didn't write it in this call.
//                       We need to report the byte count back to the caller without including this byte
//                       in the calculation as it wasn't a part of what was given in this exact call.
// Return Value:
// - <none>

// Routine Description:
// - For UTF-8 codepages, remembers how many bytes that the UTF-8 parser said it consumed from the input stream.
//   This will allow us to give back the correct value after the wait routine Notify services the data later.

// - cchUtf8Consumed - Count of characters consumed by the UTF-8 parser off the input stream to generate the
//                     wide character string that is stowed in this object for consumption in the notify routine later.

// Routine Description:
// - Called back at a later time to resume the writing operation when the output object becomes unblocked.
// Arguments:
// - TerminationReason - if this routine is called because a ctrl-c or ctrl-break was seen, this argument
//                      contains CtrlC or CtrlBreak. If the owning thread is exiting, it will have ThreadDying. Otherwise, 0.
// - fIsUnicode - Input data was in UCS-2 unicode or it needs to be converted with the current Output Codepage
// - pReplyStatus - The status code to return to the client application that originally called the API (before it was queued to wait)
// - pNumBytes - The number of bytes of data that the server/driver will need to transmit back to the client process
// - pControlKeyState - Unused for write operations. Set to 0.
// - pOutputData - not used.
// - true if the wait is done and result buffer/status code can be sent back to the client.
// - false if we need to continue to wait because the output object blocked again
