    HANDLE hSignal;
    // The "server handle" in conhost represents the console IPC "pipe" over which all console
    // messages, all client connect and disconnect events, API calls, text output, etc. flow.
    // The full type of this handle is \Device\ConDrv\Server and is implemented in
    // /minkernel/console/condrv/server.c. If you inspect conhost's handles it'll show up
    // as a handle of name \Device\ConDrv, because that's the namespace of these handles.
    //
    // hPtyReference is derived from that handle (= a child), is named \Reference and is implemented
    // in /minkernel/console/condrv/reference.c. While conhost is the sole owner and user of the
    // "server handle", the "reference handle" is what console processes actually inherit in order
    // to communicate with the console server (= conhost). When the reference count of the
    // \Reference handle drops to 0, it'll release its reference to the server handle.
    // The server handle in turn is implemented in such a way that the IPC pipe is broken
    // once the reference count drops to 1, because then conhost must be the last one using it.
    //
    // In other words: As long as hPtyReference exists it'll keep the server handle alive
    // and thus keep conhost alive. Closing this handle will make conhost exit as soon as all
    // currently connected clients have disconnected and closed the reference handle as well.
    //
    // This benefit of this system is that it naturally works with handle inheritance in
    // CreateProcess,  which ensures that the reference handle is safely duplicated and
    // transmitted from a parent process to a new child process, even if the parent
    // process exits before the OS has even finished spawning the child process.
