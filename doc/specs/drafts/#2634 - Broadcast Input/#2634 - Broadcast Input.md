# Broadcast Input

## Abstract

"Broadcast Input" is a feature present on other terminals which allows the user
to send the same input to multiple tabs or panes at the same time. This can make
it simpler for the user to run the same command in multiple directories or
servers at the same time.

With a viable prototype in [#9222], it's important that we have a well-defined
plan for how we want this feature to be exposed before merging that PR. This
spec is intended to be a lighter-than-usual spec to build consensus on the
design of how the actions should be expressed.

## Background

### Inspiration

This spec is heavily inspired by the [iTerm2 implementation]. @carlos-zamora did
a great job of breaking down how iTerm2 works in [this comment].

SecureCRT also implements a similar feature using a "chat window" that can send
the input in the chat window to all tabs. This seemed like a less ergonomic
solution, so it was not seriously considered.

Additionally, Terminator (on \*nix) allows for a similar feature through the use
of "groups". From [@zljubisic]:

> In Linux terminator you can define groups, and than put each pane in one of
> defined groups. Afterwards, you can choose broadcasting to all panes, only
> certain group or no broadcast at all.

This also seemed like a less powerful version of broadcast input than the
iterm2-like version, so it was also not further investigated.

### User Stories

iTerm2 supports the following actions:

* **Story A:** _Send input to current session only_: The default setting.
* **Story B:** _Broadcast to all panes in all tabs_: Anything you type on the
  keyboard goes to all sessions in this window.
* **Story C:** _Broadcast to all panes in current tab_: Anything you type on the
  keyboard goes to all sessions in this tab.
* **Story D:** _Toggle broadcast input to current session_: Toggles whether this
  session receives broadcasted keystrokes within this window.


## Solution Design

### Proposal 1: iTerm2-like Modal Input Broadcast

iTerm2 implements broadcast input as a type of "modal" system. The user is in
one of the following modes:

* Broadcast to all panes in all tabs
* Broadcast to all panes in the current tab
* Broadcast to some set of panes within the current tab
* Don't broadcast input at all (the default behavior)

These modes are vaguely per-tab state. There's a global "broadcast to all tabs &
panes" property. Then, each tab also has a pair of values:
* Should input be sent to all panes in this tab?
* If not, which panes should input be sent to?

It's not possible to send input to one pane in tab A, then another pane in tab
B, without enabling the global "broadcast to everyone" mode.

This seems to break down into the following actions:

```json
{ "action": "toggleBroadcastInput", "scope": "window" },
{ "action": "toggleBroadcastInput", "scope": "tab" },
{ "action": "toggleBroadcastInput", "scope": "pane" },
{ "action": "disableBroadcastInput" },
```

Which would be accompanied by the following internal properties:
* A window (`TerminalPage`-level) property for `broadcastToAllPanesAndTabs`
* A per-tab property for `broadcastToAllPanes`
* A per-tab set of panes to broadcast to

The scopes would work as follows:

* `"scope": "window"`: Toggle the window's "broadcast to all tabs and panes"
  setting.
* `"scope": "tab"`: Toggle the tab's "broadcast to all panes in this tab"
  setting.
  - This does not modify the set of panes that the user is  broadcasting to in
      the tab, merely toggles the tab's setting. If the user has a set of panes
      they're broadcasting to in this tab, then toggles this setting on and off,
      we'll return to broadcasting to that set.
* `"scope": "pane"`: Add this pane to the set of panes being broadcasted to in
  this tab.
  - **TODO!: FOR DISCUSSION**: Should this disable the tab's
      "broadcastToAllPanes" setting? Or should it leave that alone?
* `"disableBroadcastInput"`: For this tab, set the global setting to false,
  the tab's setting to false, and clear the set of panes being broadcasted.
  - **TODO!** This could also just be `"action": "toggleBroadcastInput",
    "scope": "none"`

#### Pros
* This is exactly how iTerm2 does it, so there's prior art.
* If you're not globally broadcasting, then you're only ever broadcasting to
  some (sub)set of the panes in the current tab. So global broadcast mode is
  the only time a user would need to worry about input being to be sent to
  an inactive tab.
* You can have a set of panes to broadcast to in the first tab, then a
  _separate_ set to broadcast to in a second tab. Broadcasting in one tab
  does not affect the other.

#### Cons
* I frankly think the `tab`/`pane` interaction can be a little weird. Like for
  this scenario:
  - enable broadcast input for tab 1
  - switch to tab 2
  - enable broadcast input for a pane in tab 2

  There's valid confusion to be had between the following two behaviors:
  1. input goes to all of tab 1 _and_ the pane in tab 2
  2. input only goes to the pane in tab 2
* You can't broadcast to a subset of panes in inactive tabs, in addition to
  the active tab. All panes you want to broadcast to must be in the active
  tab.
* Does creating a new split in a pane that's being broadcast to add that pane to
  the broadcast set?

#### What would this mean for PR #9222?

The prototype PR [#9222] basically just implemented `{ "action":
"toggleBroadcastInput", "scope": "tab" }`. We could make `tab` the default
`scope` if no other one is specified, and then the PR would need basically no
modifications. Future PRs could add args to the `toggleBroadcastInput` action,
without breaking users who bind a key to that action now.

### Proposal 2: Broadcast Set

This was the design I had originally came up with before investigating iTerm2
much closer. This design involves a "broadcast set" of panes. All the panes in
the broadcast set would also get the `KeySent` and `CharSent` events, in
addition to the active pane. (The active pane may be a part of the broadcast
set). If a pane is read-only in the broadcast set, then it won't handle those
broadcasted events (obviously).

As far as actions, we're looking at something like:

* **A** Only send input to the active pane
  * Remove all the panes from the broadcast set
* **B** send input to all panes in all tabs
  * If all the panes are in the broadcast set, remove them all. Otherwise, add
    all panes in all tabs to the broadcast set.
* **C** send input to all panes in the current tab
  * If all the panes in the current tab are in the broadcast set, remove them
    from the broadcast set. Otherwise, add all the panes from this tab to the
    broadcast set.
* **D** toggle sending input to the current pane
  * If this pane is in the broadcast set, remove it. Otherwise add it.
This seems to break down into the following actions:

```json
{ "action": "disableBroadcastInput" },
{ "action": "toggleBroadcastInput", "scope": "window" },
{ "action": "toggleBroadcastInput", "scope": "tab" },
{ "action": "toggleBroadcastInput", "scope": "pane" },
```

Which would be accompanied by the following internal properties:
* A window (`TerminalPage`-level) set of panes to broadcast to.

#### Pros:
* Mentally, you're either adding panes to the set of panes to broadcast to, or
  removing them.
* You can broadcast to panes in multiple tabs, without broadcasting to _all_
  panes in all tabs.

#### Cons:
* is _slightly_ different from iTerm2.
* Does creating a new split in a pane that's being broadcast to add that pane to
  the broadcast set?
* You can't have a set of panes to broadcast to in the one tab, and a different
  set in another tab. As an example:
  1. in tab 1, you add panes A and B to the broadcast set. Typing in either one
     goes to both A and B.
  2. in tab 1, switch to pane C. Now input goes to A, B and C.
  3. in tab 1, switch to pane D. Now input goes to A, B and D.
  4. switch to tab 2, pane E. Now input goes to A, B and E.

  You can't have like, a set with A & B (in 1), then E & F (in 2). So if someone
  wants to type to both panes in 1, then both panes in 2, then both panes in 1,
  they need to keep toggling which panes are in the broadcast set.

#### What would this mean for PR #9222?

Similar to Proposal 1, we'd use `tab` as the default value for `scope`. In the
future, when we add support for the other scopes, we'd change how the
broadcasting works, to use a set of panes to broadcast to, instead of just the
tab-level property.

### Proposal 3: It's iTerm2, but slightly different

While typing this up, I thought maybe it might make more sense if we took the
iTerm2 version, and changed it slightly:

* `"scope": "tab"`: If all the panes are in the broadcast set for this tab, then
  remove them all. Otherwise, add all the panes in this tab to this tab's
  broadcast set.
* `"scope": "pane"`: If this pane is in the broadcast set for a tab, then remove
  it. Otherwise, add it.

With this, we get rid of the tab-level setting for "broadcast to all the panes
in this tab", and rely only on the broadcast set for that tab.

#### Pros:
* All the pros from proposal A
* Does away with the seemingly weird toggling between "all the panes in a tab"
  and "some of the panes in a tab" that's possible with proposal A

#### Cons:
* You can't broadcast to a subset of panes in inactive tabs, in addition to
  the active tab. All panes you want to broadcast to must be in the active
  tab.
* is _slightly_ different from iTerm2. Just _slightly_.
* Does creating a new split in a pane that's being broadcast to add that pane to
  the broadcast set?

#### What would this mean for PR #9222?

Same as with proposal A, we wouldn't change anything in the current PR. A future
PR that would add the other scope's to that action would need to change how the
broadcasting within a tab works, to use a set of panes to broadcast to, instead
of just the tab-level property.

## Conclusion

I'm proposing these settings for broader discussion. I'm not really sure which I
like most at this point. 1 & 3 have the advantage of being most similar to the
prior art, but 2 is more easily extendable to "groups" (see [Future
Considerations](#Future-Considerations)).

**TODO!**: Make a decision.

_**Fortunately**_: All these proposals actually use the same set of actions. So
it doesn't _really_ matter which we pick right now. We can unblock [#9222] as
the implementation of the `"tab"` scope, and address other scopes in the future.
We should still decide long-term which of these we'd like, but the actions seem
universal.

## UI/UX Design

This is supposed to be a quick & dirty spec, so I'm LARGELY skipping this.

As far as indicators go, we'll throw something like:

![NetworkTower Segoe UI Icon](broadcast-segoe-icon.png)

in the tab when a pane is being broadcasted to. If all tabs are being
broadcasted to, then they'll all have that icon. If a tab is inactive, and any
pane in that tab is being broadcast to, then show the icon in the tab.

It probably makes the most sense to have pane titlebars ([#4998]) also display
that icon.

In the original PR, it was suggested to use some variant of the [accent color]
to on the borders of panes that are currently receiving broadcasted input. We're
already using the accent color on the borders of the active pane.
`SystemAccentColorLight*`/`SystemAccentColorDark*` would provide a way of using
a similar hue with different lightness/saturation. This would be a decent visual
indicator that they're _not_ the active pane, but they are going to receive
input. Something a bit like:

![A sample of using the border to indicate the broadcasted-to panes](broadcast-input-borders.gif)

This should obviously be able to be overridden in the user's theme, similar to
the pane border colors.

iTerm2 also supports displaying "stripes" in the background of all the panes
that are being broadcast too. That's certainly another way of indicating this
feature to the user. I'm not sure how we'd layer it with the background image
though. **I recommend we ignore this for now, and leave this as a follow-up**.

### Tab context menu items

For reference, refer to the following from iTerm2:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2578976/64075757-fa971980-ccee-11e9-9e44-47aaf3bca76c.png)

We don't have a menu bar like on macOS, but we do have a tab context menu. We
could add these items as a nested entry under each tab. If we wanted to do this,
we should also make sure to dynamically change the icon of the MenuItem to
reflect the current broadcast state.

## Potential Issues

[comment]: # If there are any other potential issues, make sure to include them here.

## Implementation plan

* [ ] Resurrect [#9222], and use that to implement `"scope": "tab"`. This is
  implemented the same, regardless of which proposal we chose.
* [ ] Add a tab context menu entry for toggling broadcast input, with a dynamic
  icon based on the current state.
* [ ] Implement `"scope": "window"`. Again, this is implemented the same regardless
  of which proposal we pursue.
* [ ] Decide between the two proposals here.
* [ ] Implement `"scope": "pane"`.

Doing the first element here is probably the most important one for most users,
and can be done regardless of the proposal chosen here. As such, we could even
suggest the default value of `scope` be `tab`. If we did that, then we wouldn't
need to do any args at all in the initial version.

## Future Considerations

Let's look to iTerm2, who's supported this feature for years, for some
inspiration of future things we should be worried about. If their users have
asked for these features, then it's inevitable that our users will too 😉

* [iterm2#6709] - Broadcast Input to multiple windows
  - This is pretty straightforward. Would require coordination with the Monarch
    though, and I'm worried about the perf hit of tossing every keystroke across
    the process boundary.
  - I suppose this would be `{ "action": "toggleBroadcastInput", "scope":
    "global" }`
* [iterm2#6451], [iterm2#5563] - "Broadcast commands"
  - iTerm2 has an action that lets the user manually clear the terminal-side
    buffer. (This is tracked on the Windows Terminal as [#1882]). It might make
    sense for there to be a mode where some _actions_ are also broadcast to
    panes, not just key strokes. But which actions would those be? Moving the
    selection anchors? Copy doesn't really make sense. Paste _does_ though.
    Maybe the open find dialog / next&prev search match actions?
  - This probably would require its own spec.
* [iterm2#6007] - Different stripe color for different broadcast modes
  - Have one color to indicate when broadcasting in `global` scope, another in
    `tab` scope, a third in `pane` scope.
  - This might mesh well with theming ([#3327]), for properties like
    `pane.broadcastBorderColor.globalScope`,
    `pane.broadcastBorderColor.paneScope`. Don't love those names, but you get
    the idea.
* **[iterm2#5639]: Broadcast groups**, [iterm2#3372] - Broadcast Input to
  multiple but not all tabs
  - This is probably the most interesting request. I think this one identifies a
    major shortcoming of the above proposals. With proposal 2, there's only ever
    one top-level broadcast group. With proposals 1 & 3, there's per-tab
    broadcast groups. In neither proposal can you have multiple concurrent
    side-by-side broadcast groups.
  - Groups should probably work across tabs. This would suggest that Proposal 2
    is closer to how groups would work. Instead of there being one top-level
    set, there would be multiple. **I'm not sure how proposals 1&3 would
    seamlessly transition into also supporting groups**.
  - The major trick here is: how do we differentiate these different groups to
    the user? If we used the broadcast icon with a number, maybe in the corner
    of the tab? Like [📡: 1]? Can a pane be in multiple broadcast sets at the
    same time?
  - The natural arg idea would be `{ "action": "toggleBroadcastInput", "scope":
    "tab", "group": 1 }` to say "add all panes in the tab to broadcast group 1",
    or "remove all panes in the tab from broadcast group 1". If panes are in
    another group, they'd be moved to the specified group. If all panes are in
    that group, then remove them all.
  - The UI for this would certainly get complex fast.
  - This also matches the Terminator-style broadcasting to groups.
* Re: stripes in the background of the tab. We could expose a pane's current
  broadcast state to the pixel shader, and a user could use a custom pixel
  shader to add stripes behind the text in the shader code. That's one possible
  solution.
