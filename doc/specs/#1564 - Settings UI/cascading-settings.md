# Cascading Settings

## Abstract

Windows Terminal's settings model adheres to a cascading settings architecture. This allows a settings object to be defined incrementally across multiple layers of declarations. The value for any global setting like `copyOnSelect`, for example, is set to your settings.json value if one is defined; otherwise, defaults.json, and otherwise a system set value. Profiles in particular are more complicated in that they must also take into account the values in `profiles.defaults` and dynamic profile generators.

This spec explores how to represent this feature in the Settings UI.

## Inspiration

Cascading settings (and `profiles.defaults` by extension) provide some major benefits:
1. opt-in behavior for settings values provided in-box (i.e. reset to default)
2. easy way to apply a setting to all your profiles
3. (possible future feature) simple way to base a profile off of another profile

The following terminal emulators approach this issue as follows.
| Terminal Emulator(s) | Relevant Features/Approach |
|--|--|
| ConEmu, Cmder | "Clone" a separate profile |
| Fluent Terminal | "Restore Defaults" button on each page |
| iTerm2 | "Bulk Copy from Selected Profile..." and "Duplicate Profile" |

Other Settings UIs have approached this issue as follows:
| Project | Relevant Approach |
|--|--|
| Visual Studio | Present a dropdown with your options. An extra "\<inherit\>" option is shown to inherit a value from another place. |

## Solution Design

The XAML implementation will consist of introducing a `ContentControl` for each setting. The `ContentControl` simply wraps the XAML control used for a setting, then adds the chosen UI approach below.

The `ContentControl` will take advantage of the following TerminalSettingsModel APIs for each setting:
```c++
// Note: String and "Name" are replaced for each setting
bool HasName();
void ClearName();
String Name();
void Name(String val);
```

## UI/UX Design Proposals

The proposals below will be used in combination with each other.

### 1: Text under a setting control

This design renames the "Global" page under Profiles to "Base layer". Settings that override those in profile.defaults will get text under the control saying "Overrides Base layer.". Next to the titles of controls that override the base layer is a reset button with a tooltip that says "Reset".

### Add New --> Duplicate Profile

The Add new profile button in the navigation menu would take you to a new page. This page will have radio buttons listing your profiles along with a default settings option. The user can choose to either duplicate a profile or create a new one from the default settings. Once the user makes a selection, the settings UI will take them to their new profile page. The fields on that profile page will be filled according to which profile selection the user made.

### Reset Profile button

On the Advanced pivot of a profile's page, there will be a button at the bottom for resetting a profile called "Reset to default settings". This button will remove the user's custom settings inside this profile's object and reset it to defaults, prioritizing profile.defaults then defaults.json.

### "Apply to all profiles" button

A way we could apply settings to all profiles is by adding a "Copy settings to..." button to the Advanced page of each profile. This button will open a content dialog with a tree view listing every profile setting. The user can select which settings they would like to copy over to another profile. At the bottom of the content dialog will list the user's profiles with checkboxes, allowing them to pick which profiles they'd like to copy settings to.

## Previously considered ideas

These ideas were considered however we will not be moving forward with them.

### 1: \<inherit\> option

Each setting is an Editable ComboBox (except for boolean and enumerable settings). For booleans, the items will be Enabled and Disabled in a regular ComboBox. Enumerable settings will have their options listed in a regular ComboBox. For integers, most commonly used numbers will be listed.

![Dropdown inheritance](./inheritance-dropdown.png)

**Pros**

- Doesn't clutter the screen.

**Cons**

- Every setting is a dropdown.

**Pitfalls**

- How will color pickers work with this scenario?

**Other considerations**

Each dropdown has either "inherit" or "custom". If the user selects "custom", the original control will appear (i.e. a color picker for colors or a number picker for integers).

This option was not chosen because it added too much overhead for changing a setting. For example, if you wanted to enable acrylic, you'd have to click the dropdown, select custom, watch the checkbox appear, and then select the checkbox.

### 2: Lock Button

Every setting will have a lock button next to it. If the lock is locked, that means the setting is being inherited from Global, and the control is disabled. If the user wants to edit the setting, they can click the lock, which will changed it to the unlocked lock icon, and the control will become enabled.

![Locks inheritance](./inheritance-locks.png)

**Pros**

- Least amount of clutter on the screen while still keeping the original controls

**Cons**

- The lock concept is slightly confusing. Some may assume locking the setting means that it *won't* be inherited from Global and that it's "locked" to the profile. This is the opposite case for its current design. However, flipping the logic of the locks wouldn't make sense with an unlocked lock and a disabled control.

## Capabilities

### Accessibility

All of these additions to the settings UI will have to be accessibility tested.

### Security

These changes will not impact security.

### Reliability

These changes will not impact reliability.

### Compatibility

The partial parity with JSON route will give the settings UI a different compatibility from the JSON file itself. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The settings UI is intended to be a simplistic way for people to successfully edit their settings. If too many options are added to give it fully parity with JSON, it could compromise the simplistic benefit the settings UI provides.

### Performance, Power, and Efficiency

These changes will not impact performance, power, nor efficiency.

## Potential Issues

## Future considerations

When we add profile inheritance later, we can implement a layering page using a rearrangeable TreeView.
